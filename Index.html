    <p>Akan means first. The Akan is a unique group of people found in Ghana and Ivory Coast. Historically,
        the Ghanaian population migrated to the Ivory Coast and became the most populous group of people in 
        the country. The Akan language is known as Fante or Twi; it is a group of dialects within the Niger-Congo 
        family of languages.</p>
    
    <p>The Akan people, an ethnic group in Ghana, have a naming tradition where each day of the week is associated
         with a specific name. These names are given to babies based on the day they are born. The Akan naming system
        is also used by other ethnic groups in Ghana, such as the Ashanti and Fante.</p>
